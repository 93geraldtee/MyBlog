# My Blog Coding Challenge

Fork and clone this repo to your local computer. Then run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed`. Then, as a group, work through the following coding challenges. If possible, switch who is the "driver" for each challenge.


## Challenge 1:

* Create a categories index view to display all of the categories

* Under each Category name, list the posts for that category and link to each post show page

## Challenge 2:

* Create a '/users/most-active' route that will display the 3 "most active" users (i.e. the 3 users who have made the most posts).
  - route
  - view
  - controller
  - model

* This view should also display a count for how many posts each user created

## Challenge 3:

* Add a column to the Comments table so that a user can rate the post (1-5) when they make a comment

* Add the rest of the functionality so that a user can provide a rating when they fill out the comment form and display that rating next to the comment

* BONUS: Average the ratings of each post and sort the posts by average rating on the posts index view.
